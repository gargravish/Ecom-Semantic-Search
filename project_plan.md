To refactor the application and make it more modern, intuitive, and exciting for users, we can migrate from Streamlit to Flask. Flask offers more flexibility and control over the frontend and backend, allowing for a more customized user experience.

Project Goals

Migrate from Streamlit to Flask: Develop the backend using Flask to handle API requests and data processing.
Modernize Frontend: Create a new frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (possibly with a framework like React or Vue.js) to provide a more interactive and visually appealing user interface.
Improve User Experience: Design a more intuitive user interface with enhanced features and interactions.
Enhance Functionality: Add new features to make the application more useful and engaging.
Project Plan

Phase 1: Backend Development (Flask)

Set up Flask Project:
Create a new Flask project structure.
Install necessary Flask libraries and dependencies.
API Endpoints:
Develop Flask API endpoints to handle image and text uploads.
Implement endpoints for communication with Vertex AI (embedding generation and Feature Store search).
Create endpoints for querying BigQuery and processing the data.
Authentication and Authorization (Optional):
Implement user authentication and authorization if needed.
Testing:
Write unit tests for Flask API endpoints.
Test the integration with Vertex AI and BigQuery.
Phase 2: Frontend Development

Frontend Design:
Design the user interface with a focus on usability and visual appeal.
Choose a frontend framework (e.g., React, Vue.js) or use plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Frontend Implementation:
Develop the frontend components to handle user input (text, image uploads).
Implement the logic to make API requests to the Flask backend.
Display search results in an interactive and engaging manner.
Integration:
Integrate the frontend with the Flask backend API.
Testing:
Test the frontend components and interactions.
Perform end-to-end testing to ensure the frontend and backend work together seamlessly.
Phase 3: Enhancements and Additional Functionalities

User Account Management (Optional):
Implement user registration, login, and profile management.
Search History:
Store user search queries and results to allow users to revisit previous searches.
Product Recommendations:
Implement a recommendation system to suggest related products based on search history or viewed items.
Visual Search Improvements:
Enhance the image search functionality with features like object detection or similar image search.
Filtering and Sorting:
Add options to filter and sort search results based on price, category, or other criteria.
Real-time Updates:
Implement real-time updates for product availability or pricing.
Deployment:
Deploy the Flask application and frontend to a suitable hosting platform.
Additional Functionalities to Excite Users

Personalized Recommendations: Implement a system that learns user preferences and provides personalized product recommendations.
Visual Search with Object Detection: Allow users to upload an image and select specific objects within the image to search for similar products.
Augmented Reality (AR) Integration: Enable users to visualize products in their own space using AR technology.
Social Sharing: Allow users to share their favorite products with friends on social media.
Interactive Product Exploration: Provide 3D models or virtual tours of products to enhance the shopping experience.
Gamification: Introduce elements of gamification, such as badges or rewards, to encourage user engagement.
This detailed plan provides a roadmap for refactoring the application, enhancing its functionality, and creating a more engaging user experience.
