To refactor the application and make it more modern, intuitive, and exciting for users, we can migrate from Streamlit to Flask. Flask offers more flexibility and control over the frontend and backend, allowing for a more customized user experience.

Project Goals

Migrate from Streamlit to Flask: Develop the backend using Flask to handle API requests and data processing.
Modernize Frontend: Create a new frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (possibly with a framework like React or Vue.js) to provide a more interactive and visually appealing user interface.
Improve User Experience: Design a more intuitive user interface with enhanced features and interactions.
Enhance Functionality: Add new features to make the application more useful and engaging.
